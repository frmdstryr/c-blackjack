/*
 * blackjack.c
 *
 *  Created on: Mar 1, 2014
 *      Author: jrm
 *
 *  Specification
 *      You are to write a multi-player blackjack program. The program must enforce a maximum of six
 *      players. The program must make use of unnamed pipes. The parent process will be the dealer.
 *      The children processes will be the players. The game continues until there are no players left. To
 *      leave the game a player bets $0. When a player enters the game, they will tell the dealer the
 *      amount of money they will use to begin the game.
 *      The program must implement signal handlers for the termination (SIGINT) and stop (SIGTSTP)
 *      signals. If the program receives the termination signal (because all players left the game or from
 *      the keyboard), the user should be prompted to shutdown the game or start a new game. If the
 *      program receives the stop signal and there are no players left, the program should end gracefully;
 *      if there are players still in the game, the signal should be ignored.
 *
 *      The following will be processes of your program:
 *      * Dealer process
 *        - Shuffle the cards
 *        - Get initial bets from players
 *        - Deal the cards to the players and the dealer using a random-number generator
 *        - Determine which player(s) wins
 *      * Players processes (one child process for each player)
 *        - Ask the user how much they want to bet
 *        - Get cards from dealer and tell user
 *        - Repeat until player stays
 *            * Ask the user if they want to stay or hit (take a card)
 *            * Tell the dealer decision (stay or hit)
 *
 *   Usage Clause:
 *      blackjack <number_of_players>
 *
 *   Notes
 *     - Do not implement the blackjack concepts of double-down or splitting.
 *     - All players should be able to view the dealerâ€™s hand.
 *     - Any non-reentrant function that is interrupted by a signal must be restarted.
